###Graylog is an open-source log management tool that helps you to collect, index and analyze any machine logs centrally. This guide focuses on installing Graylog on Ubuntu 18.04 / Ubuntu 16.04.
###Components

###MongoDB – Acts as a database, stores the configurations and meta information.

###Elasticsearch – It stores the log messages and offers a searching facility. It is recommended to allocate more memory and use SAS or SAN disks for Elasticsearch nodes. Here, where all your searching happens.

###Graylog Server – Log Parser. It collects the logs from various inputs and provides output to a built-in web interface for managing the logs.
###Prerequisites

###As you know, Elasticsearch is a java based application. Install either OpenJDK or Oracle JDK on your machine to proceed further.


###I will go for OpenJDK 8.
# sudo apt update
# sudo apt install -y apt-transport-https openjdk-8-jre-headless uuid-runtime pwgen curl dirmngr

###Verify the Java version.
# java -version

###Output:
##openjdk version "1.8.0_191"
##OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_191-8u191-b12-2ubuntu0.18.04.1-b12)
##OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.191-b12, mixed mode)



###Install Elasticsearch

###Elasticsearch is one of the main components which requires Graylog to run, acts as a search server, offers a real-time distributed search and analytics with the RESTful web interface.
###Elasticsearch stores all the logs sent by the Graylog server and displays the messages whenever user request over the built-in web interface.

###Download and install the GPG signing key.
# wget -qO - https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | sudo apt-key add -

###Set up Elasticsearch repository by running below command.
# echo "deb https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/6.x/apt stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-6.x.list

###Update the repository cache and install Elasticsearch package.
# sudo apt update
# sudo apt install -y elasticsearch

###Make Elasticsearch service to start automatically on the system startup.
# sudo systemctl enable elasticsearch

###The only important thing is to set a cluster name as graylog. Edit the configuration file of Elasticsearch and update it accordingly.
# sudo nano /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml

###Set the cluster name shown like below.
##cluster.name: graylog

###Start the Elasticsearch service to read the new configurations.
# sudo systemctl restart elasticsearch

###Wait at least a minute to let the Elasticsearch get fully restarted. Elastisearch should be now listening on 9200 for the processing HTTP request. Use a CURL to check the response.
# curl -X GET http://localhost:9200

###Output:
###Ensure that cluster name shows as graylog.
{
  "name" : "bgVbYrc",
  "cluster_name" : "graylog",
  "cluster_uuid" : "-wECQlwnSZWftd_XdWSz-g",
  "version" : {
    "number" : "6.6.1",
    "build_flavor" : "default",
    "build_type" : "deb",
    "build_hash" : "1fd8f69",
    "build_date" : "2019-02-13T17:10:04.160291Z",
    "build_snapshot" : false,
    "lucene_version" : "7.6.0",
    "minimum_wire_compatibility_version" : "5.6.0",
    "minimum_index_compatibility_version" : "5.0.0"
  },
  "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
}

###Optional: Test the health of Elasticsearch cluster.
# curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/_cluster/health?pretty=true'

###Output:
###Make sure the output yields the cluster status as green.
{
  "cluster_name" : "graylog",
  "status" : "green",
  "timed_out" : false,
  "number_of_nodes" : 1,
  "number_of_data_nodes" : 1,
  "active_primary_shards" : 0,
  "active_shards" : 0,
  "relocating_shards" : 0,
  "initializing_shards" : 0,
  "unassigned_shards" : 0,
  "delayed_unassigned_shards" : 0,
  "number_of_pending_tasks" : 0,
  "number_of_in_flight_fetch" : 0,
  "task_max_waiting_in_queue_millis" : 0,
  "active_shards_percent_as_number" : 100.0
}



###Install MongoDB

###Download and install the latest version of MongoDB from the official website. Import the public key on the terminal to begin.
# sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv 9DA31620334BD75D9DCB49F368818C72E52529D4

###Add mongodb repository by creating the /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org.list file using the following command.

### Ubuntu 18.04 ###
echo "deb [ arch=amd64 ] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu bionic/mongodb-org/4.0 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-4.0.list

### Ubuntu 16.04 ###
# echo "deb [ arch=amd64,arm64 ] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu xenial/mongodb-org/4.0 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-4.0.list

### Install MongoDB using the following command.
# sudo apt update
# sudo apt install -y mongodb-org

###Start the MongoDB and enable it on the system start-up.
# sudo systemctl start mongod
# sudo systemctl enable mongod



###Install Graylog

###Graylog Server accepts and processes the log messages and then displays it for the requests that come from the graylog web interface.

###Download and Install graylog 3.x repository.
# wget https://packages.graylog2.org/repo/packages/graylog-3.0-repository_latest.deb
# sudo dpkg -i graylog-3.0-repository_latest.deb

###Update the repository cache.
# sudo apt update

###Install the Graylog server using the following command.
# sudo apt install -y graylog-server

###Configure Graylog
###You must set a secret to secure the user passwords. Use the pwgen command to the same.
# pwgen -N 1 -s 96

##Output:
##fGoTI07CooB6xNy5sdPVSKSuq6QSu2QyWf6G9z3haolgwbERTQ9ZbfbF6hxRYbJMMAlEZX7CXHxJLBkNyfM0420u8aFuZy9M

###Edit the server.conf file to begin the graylog configuration.
# sudo nano /etc/graylog/server/server.conf

###Place the secret like below.
##password_secret = fGoTI07CooB6xNy5sdPVSKSuq6QSu2QyWf6G9z3haolgwbERTQ9ZbfbF6hxRYbJMMAlEZX7CXHxJLBkNyfM0420u8aFuZy9M

###Next is to set a hash (sha256) password for the root user (not to be confused with the system user, the root user of graylog is admin).
###You will need this password to login into the Graylog web interface. Admin’s password can’t be changed using the web interface. So, you must edit this variable to set.

###Replace yourpassword with the choice of yours.
# echo -n yourpassword | sha256sum

##Output:
##e3c652f0ba0b4801205814f8b6bc49672c4c74e25b497770bb89b22cdeb4e951

###Edit the server.conf file again.
# sudo nano /etc/graylog/server/server.conf

###Place the hash password.
##root_password_sha2 = e3c652f0ba0b4801205814f8b6bc49672c4c74e25b497770bb89b22cdeb4e951

###You can set up email address admin user.
##root_email = "itzgeek.web@gmail.com"

###Set timezone of root (admin) user.
##root_timezone = UTC

###Set only one master node by defining the below variable. If you add a second Graylog node, set this to false to make the second node as a slave as the Master node does some periodic tasks that slave nodes won’t perform.
##is_master = true

###Set the number of log messages to keep per index; it is recommended to have several smaller indices instead of larger ones.
##elasticsearch_max_docs_per_index = 20000000

###The following parameter defines to have a total number of indices if this number is reached old index will be deleted.
##elasticsearch_max_number_of_indices = 20

###Shards setting rely on the number of nodes in the particular Elasticsearch cluster. If you have only one node, set it as 1.
##elasticsearch_shards = 1

###This setting defines the number of replicas for your indices. If you have only one node in the Elasticsearch cluster, then set it as 0.
##elasticsearch_replicas = 0

###Setup Graylog web interface
###From the version 2.x, the web interface is being served directly by the Graylog server. Configure the Graylog web interface by editing the server.conf file.
# sudo nano /etc/graylog/server/server.conf

###Update the below entry with your system ip address from which you will access the Graylog web interface.
##http_bind_address = your-server-ip:9000

###Restart Graylog service.
# sudo systemctl restart graylog-server

###Make Graylog server to start automatically on system startup.
# sudo systemctl enable graylog-server

###You can check out the server startup logs, and it will be useful for you to troubleshoot Graylog in case of an issue.
# sudo tail -f /var/log/graylog-server/server.log

###On the successful start of graylog-server, you should get the following message in the log file.
##2019-02-22T10:07:49.398+05:30 INFO  [ServerBootstrap] Graylog server up and running.


###Access Graylog

###The web interface will now be listening on port 9000, point your browser to http://ip.add.re.ss:9000
###Login with username admin and the password you configured at root_password_sha2 on server.conf.

###Once you logged in, you would see the getting started page.
